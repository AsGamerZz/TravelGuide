String lahore =
    "The origin of Lahore can be traced back somewhere between 1st and 7th centuries A.D. It is, however, inferred by historians that Lahore was actually founded by Loh e son of Rama, characterized as the Hindu god in Ramayana. According to Sir Robert Montgomery, Lahore rose to importance between 2nd and 4th centuries. According to the Greek geographer, Ptolemy, Lahore was founded somewhere at the end of the 1st century. According to the book ood-e-Aalamahore appeared as a town in 882 AD.The people of Lahore, when they want to emphasize the uniqueness of their town say Lahore is Lahore. The traditional capital of Punjab for a thousand years, it had been the cultural center of Northern India extending from Peshawar to New Delhi. This preeminent position it holds in Pakistan as well. Lahore is the city of poets, artists and the center of film industry. It has the largest number of educational institutions in the country and some of the finest gardens in the continent. The city as we know it today, reached its peak of glory during the Moghul rulers, especially in the reign of Akbar the Great, who made it his capital. His son, Jehangir, is buried in its outskirts and his mausoleum is one of the places frequented by tourists and Lahorites alike. Close by is the mausoleum of the famous Moghul Empress, Nur Jehan, who is known for introducing the rose plant and for initiating several cultural movements in the Sub-Continent. Akbar the Great held his Court In Lahore for 14 years from 1584 to 1598, and built the Lahore Fort, as well as the city walls which had 12 gates. Some of these still survive. Jehangir and Shah Jehan, the builders of the Taj Mahal in Agra and the Shalamar Gardens in Srinagar and Lahore, built palaces and tombs. The last great Moghul Emperor, Aurangzeb (1838 - 1707) built Lahore's most famous monument, the great Badshahi Mosque. At that time the river Ravi, which now lies a few miles away from Lahore, touched the ramparts of the Fort and the Mosque. A stream still flaws there and is known as theOld River. The Sikhs ruled it in the 18th and 19th centuries, and though it was their capital, they had a habit of damaging the Muslim monuments and took little interest in gardens. It is said that they took enough marble from the Moghul monuments of Lahore to build the Golden Temple at Amratsar twice over. Most of the gems that decorated the palaces and the forts were also taken out.";
String karachi =
    "Karachi was a small fishing village when a group of traders moved there in the early 18th century from the decaying port of Kharak Bandar nearby. Besides the natural protection against monsoon storms, Manora Head furnished an excellent site for the defense of the harbour, and the Talpura amīrs who gained Karachi from the khān of Kalāt in 1795 erected a permanent fort on it. The settlement expanded rapidly and was already of significance when it was captured in 1839 by the British, who annexed it in 1842, together with the province of Sindh. It then became an army headquarters for the British and also began to develop from a fishing village into the principal port for the Indus River region. In 1843 a river-steamer service was introduced between Karachi and Multān, about 500 miles up the Indus. Port facilities were improved from 1854 onward. In 1861 a railway was built from Karachi to Kotri, 90 miles upstream on the right bank of the Indus, opposite Hyderabad. In 1864 direct telegraph communications were established with London and with the interior. With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the importance of Karachi grew, and it became a full-fledged seaport. By 1873 it possessed an efficient and well-managed harbour. Karachi was connected directly with the hinterland when the railway line was extended from Kotri in 1878 to join the Delhi-Punjab railway system at Multān. In 1886 the Karachi Port Trust was established as the port authority, and between 1888 and 1910 the East Wharf—186,000 feet in length—was constructed. When the Punjab emerged as the granary of India in the 1890s, Karachi became the region’s principal outlet. By 1914 it had become the largest grain exporting port of the British Empire.After World War I, manufacturing and service industries were installed. By 1924 an aerodrome had been built, and Karachi became the main airport of entry to India. The city became the provincial capital of Sindh in 1936.";
